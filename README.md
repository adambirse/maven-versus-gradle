#Maven versus Gradle

Having discovered gradle a few years ago I am a big convert.  This project highlighs some of the benefits that I feel make using gradle a no brainer.

When talking to people about gradle they often say to me 

>"I have used it for Android development"

This is often quickly followed by
 > "I didnt like it"

I would actually agree with this, the android use of gradle doesnt seem the most intuitive to me and it certainly doesn't seem to produce very fast builds (see my comments below)

Like any technology Gradle is ultimately only a tool and it is up to you to apply good design principles and solutions to make the most of it.  I hope this project helps.

So what are some of the things that I like about Gradle:

- [Speed] (speed.md) - much much faster.
- Convention over configuration: Gradle build files are much easier to read and understand
- Modular approach
- Rich eco system of third party plugins
- Extensible with custom tasks: Written in groovy.
