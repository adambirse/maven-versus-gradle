# Maven versus Gradle

Having discovered gradle a few years ago I am a big convert.  This project highlights some of the benefits that I feel make using gradle a no brainer.

Like any technology Gradle is ultimately only a tool and it is up to you to apply good design principles and solutions to make the most of it.  I hope this project helps.

So what are some of the things that I like about Gradle:

- [Speed](documentation/speed.md)
- [Simplicity](documentation/simplicity.md)
- [Modular approach](documentation/modular.md)
- [Plugin support](documentation/plugins.md)
- [Extensible](documentation/extensible.md)
